This is the very first time I try to create Repository

Hi, there. My name is Owl Kestrel. I've been working on several learning projects through my academic career, and now I've just decided to move on engineering field a little bit. With the help of Github and variety of learning materials spreaded amongst the web, I'd love to be creative enough to make something new in the field.
It's been a month I'm messed with a game called Screeps. Via that game I'm learning Javascript basically. Other my interests into coding stuff is Python.
This is just a rough self-description. Thank you for your time to read through this.
